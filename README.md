# Code Console

Here's a guide to create a game console using Microsoft Make Code and adafruit compatable products. This is approximately a 10 day build each day being about 2 hours worth of work.

The goal of the project is to create a hand held game console from scratch and also create a game that can be run on the console. You will have to use CAD software to create a chassis for the electronics to sit inside. After that you will wire all the electronics in order to load a game onto the device.
